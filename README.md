Hi, world!

about me

studies

school

I am an undergraduate student in NCTU, Taiwan till 2019 technically.

project

During my second semester in junior, my group and I used video image detection technic to judge the strike ball in the baseball field with a single camera and opencv.

At the same time, a course called "Mechanical Practice" asked us to build our "own machine". The idea in our team is to make a manipulator which can automatically change the functions without re-locating.
